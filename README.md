## DESCRIPTION
This is a simulation of the wave equation of a particle in an infinite square well and how it evolves under Schrodinger's equation and under measurement.

The code takes an initial state and plots the wavefunction as it evolves in time. One can then measure the particle's state (energy, position, etc.) and
see how the wave function evolves in accordance with the Copenhagen interpretation.

## TODO
- Add the measure/collapse feature. Right now, the program only simulates a wave, but it can't collapse when measured

- Add the Schrodinger equation portion. Right now, the code only simulates a given IC in time, but it doesn't actually run through solving the Schrodinger equation.
